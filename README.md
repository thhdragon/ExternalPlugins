# Custom OneClick
My Personal build of ganom's oneclick plugin.
After opening or restarting your client toggle the plugin off and back on again.

External plugin for use with OpenOSRS, this is a seperate entity, not OpenOSRS.

## Plugin Info
* __One Click__: Probably the most popular plugin, this plugin allows you to simplify quite a large variety of tasks by reducing the amount of clicks to... 1. For instance, instead of clicking a bone and using it on the altar, just click the altar, or set a custom one inventory one click in the config. You could for instance set it to use an Apple on an Orange in one click if you desired.

## Differences between original build
* Ability to use drop-down list preset oneclicks and the custom section together as was previously available.
* Added plank make to oneclick spellcasting
* Left click Phials to use notes for oak-mahogany planks/logs on him

## NOTES
if the items have left click use by default it works great, if for example it has left click eat then it doesnt put the oneclick entry at the top. workaround im using is to use the menu entry swapper plus that superman posted to prioritize the entry.

jar is on releases page for easy access  
https://github.com/thhdragon/ExternalPlugins/releases/tag/1.0  
so for example if you want to oneclick make pineapple pizzas youd add
2118:2289
to the custom oneclick section then in the menuentryswapperplus (aka [z] Custom Swapper) youd add
use, plain pizza -> pineapple ring
to make it the left click option"

## TODO
* Left click cannon to do cannonball->cannon
* Left click leprechaun to note crops (herbs, berries, fruits/veggies)
* One tick antivenom
* Left click vork spawn to do crumble undead->zombified spawn
