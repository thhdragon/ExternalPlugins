# Custom OneClick
My Personal build of ganom's oneclick plugin.
After opening or restarting your client toggle the plugin off and back on again.

External plugin for use with OpenOSRS, this is a seperate entity, not OpenOSRS.

## Plugin Info
* __One Click__: Probably the most popular plugin, this plugin allows you to simplify quite a large variety of tasks by reducing the amount of clicks to... 1. For instance, instead of clicking a bone and using it on the altar, just click the altar, or set a custom one inventory one click in the config. You could for instance set it to use an Apple on an Orange in one click if you desired.

## Differences between original build
* Ability to use drop-down list preset oneclicks and the custom section together as was previously available.
* Added plank make to oneclick spellcasting
* Left click Phials to use notes for oak-mahogany planks/logs on him

## TODO
* Left click cannon to do cannonball->cannon
* Left click leprechaun to note crops (herbs, berries, fruits/veggies)
* One tick antivenom
* Left click vork spawn to do crumble undead->zombified spawn
